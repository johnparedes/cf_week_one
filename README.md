<h1> PURPOSE </h1>

<p>

This app is a blog and it is the beginning of my journey to understanding Ruby on Rails.  With every iteration you will see improvements and more features, but I expect that you will see a lot of mistakes.

<h1> FEEDBACK </h1>

I thank you for taking the time to look at my code.  Please let me know if there's anything I can improve.

Your pal, </br>
